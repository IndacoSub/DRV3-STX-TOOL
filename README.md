# DRV3 STX TOOL
### A tool that allows you to translate the STX files.

To obtain the STX and WRD files, you need to use other tools like https://github.com/jpmac26/DRV3-Sharp or https://github.com/SpiralFramework/Spiral
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# — Usage
- Create TWO folders wherever you like and name them "STX" and "WRD".
- Put all the STX you have inside the "STX" folder.
- Put all the WRD you have inside the "WRD" folder.
- Open the DRV3 STX TOOL;
-First, it'll ask you the "STX" folder's path, and then the "WRD"'s;
- Select "Extract text". After the extraction is over you'll find the extracted text inside a new folder called "EXTRACTED_FILES";
- Select "Repack text" when you are ready to test your translation. You can find the new files inside the "REPACKED_FILES" folder.

The two folders "EXTRACTED_FILES" and "REPACKED_FILES" are both generated in the the same folder you placed the "DRV3 STX TOOL" in.

Open and edit the "App.config" file in case you need to change the path for the "STX" or the "WRD" folder.

Use some good PO editor like Poedit to edit the ".PO" files. https://poedit.net/
